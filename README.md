# One sector partial equilibrium model of trade

Exercises:

1. Increase the tariff from 0% to 50% and analyze what is the resulting market
   equilibrium. To do this, express the effects of the policy in percentage
   change: ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%28x_1-x_0%29/x_0).
2. Solve the tariff-increases problem using a t√¢tonnement approach instead of
   using GAMS solvers.
3. Express the partial equilibrium model in exact hat algebra, calibrate it and
   solve the tariff-increase problem in this way.
